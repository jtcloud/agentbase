# ### Agent
  
# Class Agent instances represent the dynamic, behavioral element of ABM.
# Each agent knows the patch it is on, and interacts with that and other
# patches, as well as other agents.
class ABM.Agent
  # Constructor & Class Variables:
  #
  # * id:         unique identifier, promoted by agentset create() factory method
  # * breed:      the agentset this agent belongs to
  # * x,y:        position on the patch grid, in patch coordinates, default: 0,0
  # * size:       size of agent, in patch coords, default: 1
  # * color:      the color of the agent, default: randomColor
  # * shape:      the shape name of the agent, default: "default"
  # * label:      a text label drawn on my instances
  # * labelColor: the color of my label text
  # * labelOffset:the x,y offset of my label from my x,y location
  # * heading:    direction of the agent, in radians, from x-axis
  # * hidden:     whether or not to draw this agent
  # * p:          patch at current x,y location
  # * penDown:    true if agent pen is drawing
  # * penSize:    size in pixels of the pen, default: 1 pixel
  # * sprite:     an image of the agent if non null
  # * cacheLinks: if true, keep array of links in/out of me
  # * links:      array of links in/out of me.  Only used if @cacheLinks is true
  #
